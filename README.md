# Phonebook Fullstack

Minimal fullstack implementation for a phonebook. 

- Backend API in node.js, express and using MongoDB via mongoose
  - Full CRUD functionality
  - Format validation on creation of new numbers with status codes and errors returned
- Basic frontend in React with little to no styling
  - Full API access
  - Handling of errors
  - Filtering of numbers for a very basic search (would not work on a large phonebook)
  - Styling to be added later

Based on fullstackopen
